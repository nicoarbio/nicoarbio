## Hey there, I'm Nico üëã

I'm a hard working developer who wants to become a proficient Software Engineer. I love thinking about new solutions and I'm building my profile as a FullStack with stronger skills in Backend than Frontend design

My main stack is SpringBoot for backend and Angular for frontend, and I'm currently working as a Software Developer at [Despegar](https://www.despegar.com).

Previously, I worked migrating [jPos Framework](https://github.com/jpos) projects from version 1 to version 2.

I am currently learning:
- Angular v17

Next things to learn:
- Ionic (with Angular!)

I have studied, read or learned about:
- Spring Framework & SpringBoot (+ v2 to v3 migrations).
- *Java SE 21*.
- Hibernate ORM for JAVA.
- *Object-oriented paradigm* (OOP), **SOLID+**, and some **design patterns**.
- *JavaScript ES6*: => **fat arrow functions**, **async/await functions**, **promises**, **import/export syntax**.
- *SQL Queries*
- GIT as VCS.
- How to manage *REST APIs* in SpringBoot and in **Node.JS** with the **Express** package.
- Implementation of Spring Security for API Rest using JWT.
- Agile *Scrum* framework.
- *GitHub Actions* as CI/CD tool to automatize some tasks.
- *Linux*. Terminal (shell), filesystem management (files, directories and permissions), vi, libraries, DEB and RPM packages: use of APT, YUM and Zypper.
- Security. General concepts, authentication, vulnerabilities, malware, hashing.
- *OracleDB*: Flashback queries.
- *MSSQL scripts*: DDL and DML. Creation of tables with all kinds of restrictions. Also use of transactions in sotred procedures and triggers.
- MS PowerBI + MS Power Automate + MS Planner.
- *HTML, CSS, JS* (+ Bootstrap/PrimeNG/AntD/MaterialUI + AOS/Animista).
